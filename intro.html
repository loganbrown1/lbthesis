                <p>Thank you for choosing to participate in this study. You will be shown a series of
                    photographs of food. Please rate each on a scale of one to five using the stars.
                    You will be given {{data.photoList.length}} photographs to rate. The exercise typically takes
                    5 to 10 minutes. <strong>Please try to judge the photographs on their quality and desirability,
                        not on personal taste preferences.</strong> If you like, you can optionally choose a specific
                    problem with each image to describe why you gave a lower rating, or provide your own by
                    choosing Other.
